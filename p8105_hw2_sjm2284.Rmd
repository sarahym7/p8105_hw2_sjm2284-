##Problem 1
Loading the dataset, cleaning names and selecting columns, converting character to logical, made data tidy by using pivot_longer

```{r}
 NYC_transit =
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_AND_EXIT_DATA.csv", na = c("NA", ".", "")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  relocate(line:entry, ada,vending) %>% 
  select(-division:-entrance_location) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  mutate(across(starts_with("route"), as.character)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "train_route",
    values_to = "routes",
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )

```

This dataset contains the variables ada, entrance type, entry, line routes, station line, station lat, station long, and station name. This
