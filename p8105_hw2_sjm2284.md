Libraries Used for this HW

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(readxl)
```

## Problem 1

``` r
 NYC_transit =
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_AND_EXIT_DATA.csv", na = c("NA", ".", "")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  relocate(line:entry, ada,vending) %>% 
  select(-division:-entrance_location, station_location) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  mutate(vending = ifelse(vending == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  mutate(across(starts_with("route"), as.character)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    values_to = "route_name",
  ) %>% 
  relocate(station_name,station_location,route_number, route_name,line,entrance_type, entry, ada,vending)
```

This dataset contains the variables station name, station location,
train route number, routes,line, entrance type, entry, exit only,
vending, ada, station lat, and station long. I cleaned my data by using
clean names to fix the variable names, relocated the order of my
variables for legibility, selected my columns/ data of interest, mutated
the character variables from entry to logical, mutates the names of the
routes as characters because it wasn’t allowing me to run the pivot
function , then used the pivot_longer to tidy the data and combine route
numbers to one column and assign the routes their own column with the
station, and relocated again for legibility. Data is now tidy.

``` r
count(distinct(NYC_transit, station_name,line))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##       n
    ##   <int>
    ## 1   465

``` r
transit_entry = 
  NYC_transit %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct()

transit_entry = NYC_transit %>% 
  filter( vending == "FALSE") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean()

A_train =
  NYC_transit %>% 
  filter(route_name == "A") %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line) 
nrow(A_train)
```

    ## [1] 60

``` r
A_train_ada =
  NYC_transit %>% 
  filter(route_name == "A", ada== TRUE) %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line) 
nrow(A_train_ada)
```

    ## [1] 17

- There are 465 distinct stations.
- There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant.
- There proportion of entrances/ exits without vending that allow
  entrance, is 0.377.
- There are 60 stations that serve the A train, and 17 are ADA
  compliant.

## Probem 2

Importing and reading the dataset

``` r
mister_trash_data = read_excel("./data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data New.xlsx", 
                               sheet=1,
                               skip = 1,
                               range= "A2:N653",
                               na = c("NA", ".", "")) %>% 
                            janitor::clean_names() %>% 
                            mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls))) %>% 
                            mutate(year = as.character(year)) %>% 
                            mutate(trash = "mister_trash") %>% 
                            drop_na()
```

``` r
professor_trash = read_excel("./data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data New.xlsx", 
                               sheet=2,
                               skip = 1,
                               range= "A2:M121",
                               na = c("NA", ".", "")) %>% 
                            janitor::clean_names() %>% 
                            mutate(year = as.character(year)) %>% 
                            mutate(trash = "professor_trash") %>% 
                            drop_na()
```

``` r
gwynnda_trash = read_excel("./data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data New.xlsx", 
                               sheet=4,
                               skip = 1,
                               range= "A2:L265",
                               na = c("NA", ".", "")) %>% 
                            janitor::clean_names() %>% 
                            mutate(year = as.character(year)) %>% 
                            mutate(trash = "gwynnda_trash") 
```

``` r
trash_wheel_tidy = 
  bind_rows(professor_trash, gwynnda_trash, mister_trash_data) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(trash, everything())
```

In this dataset we have 15 variables which include dumpster, month,
year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles,
polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers,
homes_powered,sports_balls, and trash (to specify from which dataset).
There are a total of 1005 observations and 15 columns. The datasheets
were individually imported, in mister trash I mutated the year and same
for the rest due to years being considered as a character in one dataset
and the others as numeric so I converted them all to characters. I also
cleaned the names for reasonable variable names and mutated again to
create a variable name to identify which dataset the trash is from.

``` r
total_weight_prof =  trash_wheel_tidy %>% 
                     filter(trash == "professor_trash") %>% 
                     summarise(total_weight = sum(weight_tons, na.rm = TRUE))



total_cigs_gwn =  trash_wheel_tidy %>% 
                     filter(trash == "gwynnda_trash", year == "2022", month == "June") %>% 
                     summarise(cigarette_butts = sum(cigarette_butts))
```

- The total weight of trash collected by Professor trash wheel was
  233.26.
- In the month of June 2022 Gwynnda collected 18120 cigarette butts.

For each of the datasets I imported them through read_csv and then
cleaned the names to follow naming conventions. In the bakers files I
split the first and last name because they do not follow normal form and
removed the last name since the other datasets do not include them.I
then renamed baker to bakers just for legible purposes and noticed that
there was a Jo and Joanne, while searching online noticed that is her
nickname so I renamed it to Joanne by mutating. Same process follows for
the bakes and results except in the results I had to rename my variables
by mutating them. I used an antijoin to note any discepancies and
noticed it was Jo, so I changes the names to Joanne, in the other
anti-join there seems to be descrepancies but I am assuming its becuase
of the occupations not being involved in the results. I then merged my
datasets by doing a full join and selected my variables so that they can
be arranged in a way that makes sense when reading the CSV.

Nancy and Nadiya were predictable overall winners because they were STAR
BAKERS more than the other contestants. David was a surprise for winning
in season 10 since he never was crowned STAR BAKER.

## Problem 3, part 2

``` r
views = 
  read_csv("./data/viewers.csv",na = c("NA", ".", ""))  %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename( season_1 = series_1, season_2 = series_2, season_3 = series_3, season_4 = series_4, season_5 = series_5, season_6 = series_6, season_7 = series_7, season_8 = series_8, season_9 = series_9, season_10 = series_10) %>% 
  head(10)
```

- The average viewership in season 1 was 2.77 .
- The average viewership in season 5 was 10.0393.
